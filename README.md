# OCaml Mini Projects

Welcome to my **OCaml Mini Projects** repository! This collection of projects showcases my journey and exploration of the OCaml programming language, focusing on core concepts such as functional programming, recursion, pattern matching, and exception handling. Each project is an opportunity to deepen my understanding of OCaml while building useful tools and applications.

## Projects

### 1. [Calculator](./calculator)
A simple command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations. This project demonstrates input handling and mathematical operations in OCaml.

- **Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.

### 2. [ToDo List Application](./mini_todolist)
A command-line ToDo List manager with the ability to add, mark, unmark, delete, and sort tasks. This project highlights OCamlâ€™s ability to handle state management, recursion, and mutable data.

- **Features**: Add tasks, mark tasks as completed, sort tasks by priority.

## Prerequisites

To run the projects in this repository, you need to have **OCaml** and **Dune** installed on your system.

### Installing OCaml via OPAM (recommended)
```bash
opam install ocaml
```

### Installing Dune
```bash
opam install dune
```

## About Me

I'm passionate about learning new programming languages, and OCaml has been particularly exciting because of its strong functional programming features and static type system. Through these mini projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of OCaml's power and apply it to practical problems. I'm always looking to enhance my skills and explore more complex topics in OCaml.

## Future Enhancements

As I continue my journey with OCaml, I plan to:

- Improve exception handling and error feedback across projects.
- Add more features like task deadlines, categories, and persistent storage in the ToDo List project.
- Extend the calculator to support more complex operations and handle more sophisticated input.
- Explore more projects

## Feedback

Feedback is always welcome! If you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue. Thank you!
